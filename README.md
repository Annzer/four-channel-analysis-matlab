# four-channel-analysis-matlab
This matlab code analyzes four different channels (1)AWGN (2)Rayleigh (3)Laise (4)Natagami BER under the different SNR by QPSK modulation.
After run this code, dynamic constellation diagram variation under different SNR will show in your screen. Well, I paste some result below.

The result is shown below:

## Analysis of the results
### Constellation diagram analysis  
As shown in Fig1-3, as the increasing of SNR the points in diagram become more compact and orderly.
